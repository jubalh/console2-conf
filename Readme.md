My configuration file for Console2.

I am using the [Solarized](http:://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color theme which was ported to [Console2](http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/) by [Steven Harman](https://github.com/stevenharman/console2-solarized).

One tab is configured to start the windows command prompt. And another will start cygwin with zsh.
Which obviously should be installed.

You can place this file in the same directory like the Console2 executable.
Or in `%HOMEPATH%\AppData\Roaming\Console`.
